- **We are not attempting to hijack what [`mbrn`](https://github.com/mbrn/material-table) has created**
- **We will always remain a true fork of `mbrn/material-table`**
  - We plan on pushing all changes upstream
- **We will ~~always~~ attempt to remain 100% compatible with `mbrn/material-table`**
  - Ok so the "always" part was a stretch. [See here](https://material-table-core.github.io/docs/breaking-changes) for more.
  - We are here to resolve issues, not hijack a repo
- Life happens, and `mbrn` has become rather busy
- Only `mbrn` can update `material-table`
- We have chosen to support `mbrn` and `material-table` with the hopes of keeping the project alive
